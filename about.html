                            I am a senior at the University of California, Berkeley studying Cognitive Science and Data Science. 
                            In the Summer and Spring of 2020, I was introduced to both the worlds of data and development. 
                            In the Fall of 2020, I’ve challenged myself with the task of becoming competent with the skills of 
                            a Data Analyst as well as a Web Developer.
                        </p>

                            Outside of academia, I’d describe myself as an athlete, musician, and video-game enthusiast! 
                            I’m the captain of Berkeley’s Division 1 esports Valorant team, a member of Cal Band, and have 
                            competed and participated in numerous athletic events for all my life from martial arts to 
                            swimming to Spartan Races! If you have any questions about any of these or if you'd like to talk to me
                            about anything, just message me at any time!
