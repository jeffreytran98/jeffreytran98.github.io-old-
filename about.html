                                I am a newly grad ('21) at the University of California, Berkeley with a Bachelors in Cognitive Science
                                and a minor in Data Science. In the Summer and Spring of 2020, I was introduced to both the worlds of data and development. 
                                In the Fall of 2020, Iâ€™ve challenged myself with the task of learning the skills of a Data Analyst, Web Developer, and Software Engineer.

                                As a Berkeley native, going to UC Berkeley was not a big culture shock. However, the experience of attending one of the greatest universities in the world was 
                                unforgettable. During my time at Berkeley, I've been able to explore the things that interest me the most: computer science, data science, psychology,
                                food, music, and competition!

                                Outside of academia, I enjoy playing music, being physically active, and playing video games. At Berkeley, I was the team 
                                captain of the Division 1 Valorant Team and a member of the Cal Band! When I'm not playing music or on Discord playing games with my 
                                friends, you might find me at the gym.
