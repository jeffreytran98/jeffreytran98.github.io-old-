                                    of news articles and organizations, and share their results with the world." My role for Public Editor was in 
                                    the Visualization & Data Analysis sub-team. We performed EDA (Exploratory Data Analysis) in order to help create
                                    a front-end visualization for end-users. I helped the team clean and organize the data and built an

                                    hang out and talk with their friends and communities." As an avid user of Discord, I've been thinking of ways 
                                    to make sitting in a voice/video call together more interactive and interesting with my community. Discord offers 
                                    an amazing API where developers can create cool things to make a more interactive environment in their server. 
                                    Using Discord's API, I built an interactive and functional application bot used in my own Discord server. Some functions 
                                    include fun commands and responses, as well as a mini turn based RPG dungeon game. (still a work in progress)
