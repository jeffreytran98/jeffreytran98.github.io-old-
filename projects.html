                            the Visualization & Data Analysis sub-team. We performed EDA (Exploratory Data Analysis) in order to help create
                            a front-end visualization for end-users. I helped the team clean and organize the data and built an 
                            interactive button using HTML/CSS/Javascript.

                            "Discord is a voice, video, and text communication service used by over a hundred million people to 
                            hang out and talk with their friends and communities." As an avid user of Discord, I've been thinking of ways 
                            to make sitting in a voice/video call together more interactive and interesting with my community. Discord offers 
                            an amazing API where developers can create cool things to make a more interactive environment in their server. 
                            Using Discord's API, I built an interactive and functional application bot used in my own Discord server. Some functions 
                            include fun commands and responses, as well as a mini turn based RPG dungeon game. (still a work in progress)
